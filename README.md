# A Youtube Playlist Downloader MP3

### I made this cuz why not. Also why waste time on finding a free tool to do that instade code it. And I know the code is lil bit bad kek.

### For support join [CTK's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Qu5BJmehYS) (Note: It is not my server, it is a server where i help people to fix there problems in coding.) or open a issue and i will fix it as soon as possible.
### And if you know how to fix a flaw just open a pull request.

> ## Edit config.json and add the playlist link there.
> ## So how it works is tha it gets the playlist info using ytpl and then uses ytdl to get the video and stuff and then uses ffmpeg to convert it to mp3.
